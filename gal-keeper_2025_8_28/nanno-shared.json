      ],
      "description": "One summer night, a violent storm battered the remote seaside village of Shinju Town. The disaster left deep scars on both the land and the hearts of its inhabitants, and before long the town was abandoned—its people vanishing, leaving behind a trail of unfulfilled yearnings and buried secrets…\n\nSeven years later, on another summer day, Kawakura Reiichi—a university student—steps alone into the ruined remains of Shinju Town.\n\nIt all begins with his late grandfather’s final wish—a brief return home to decide the fate of the house where they once lived together.\n\nThen, amid the lingering aromas and familiar vistas of a town that feels like another world, Reiichi meets a mysterious girl who calls herself \"Shinju.\"\n\n[i]\"Reiichi… you are destined to be the sacrifice that fulfills the shrine maiden and the box.\"[/i]\n\nReiichi and four girls find themselves trapped in Shinju Town, isolated from the outside world.\n\nAmong them is Mishio Haruna, a childhood friend who bears a striking resemblance to Shinju; Niinuma Suzu, another childhood friend from the old days of Shinju Town—a little sister in spirit; Ryugatou Yachiyo, a girl on a quest to uncover the town’s legendary treasure; and Tsuzuki Nanase, a university peer drawn into Reiichi’s troubled orbit. Then, in a chilling command, Shinju orders Reiichi to rape and impregnate the imprisoned girls.\n\nThough Reiichi and his companions band together in search of an escape, an insidious, erotic force—bound up with dark ties to their past—lures them into a vortex of debauchery, as the town fills with seductive moans.\n\nTwo girls mirror each other. \nFragmented memories and a promise once made. \nThe true identity of the deity worshipped in the town. \nThe dormant desires and sins slumbering in the forsaken village.\n\nFacing hidden truths, can Reiichi and the others ever return to the world they once knew?\n\nWhat lies concealed in the mysterious box—promised hope or the desire that seductively leads to ruin?\n\n[Translated and edited from the official site: https://www.escude.co.jp/product/haison2/world.html]",

In addition, the rest of his senses: touch, hearing, smell, and taste, are also impaired, similar to his sight, further damaging his mental health.\n\nFuminori's desire to live dwindles, and one night, while still in the hospital, he contemplates suicide.

Our hero, Koga Nao, finds himself in a classic \"morning after\" scenario with a girl he barely knows.\n\n\"You're gonna own up to this... so... you'd better date me, got it?\" demands Toiro Kirame, the girl he met at a mixer. Koga's pretty sure he was just playing Good Samaritan, but she's convinced they hooked up, and before he knows it, he's being strong-armed into \"taking responsibility.\"\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, his long-time crush, Nobuta Yua, picks this moment to drop a bombshell: \"I've decided to grace you with my presence as your girlfriend! Aren't you over the moon, Koga?\"\n\nTalk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place! After pining for Yua for ages, Koga can't exactly say no now, can he? And just like that, our protagonist makes his grand debut as an accidental two-timing scumbag.\n\nNow he's juggling two girlfriends, watching his web of lies grow more tangled by the day. As he racks his brain for a way out, the relationships around him twist and turn. To make matters worse, folks around his girlfriends are getting suspicious, and the walls are closing in.\n\nWill he sink deeper into this bottomless love swamp that's way beyond simple two-timing? Or can he somehow pull off a miracle and find a happy ending where nobody gets hurt?\n\nBuckle up for a wild ride! This roller-coaster romantic comedy – packed with heart-racing thrills and stomach-churning suspense – proves that sometimes love is a battlefield, and Koga's fighting a war on two fronts!\n\n[Translated from [url=http://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=1162879]Getchu[/url]]",

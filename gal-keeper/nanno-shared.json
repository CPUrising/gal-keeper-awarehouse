He worked hard to pass the entrance exam for the only school in the town and successfully achieved his long-cherished dream!\n\nHe moved back to the town for a new start, planning on living by himself in his childhood home, but it was in such a dilapidated state that it was essentially uninhabitable. Without the money to look for a temporary residence, Takuma was at a loss as to what to do.\n\nFortunately, his childhood friends came to his rescue! While he couldn’t live with them forever, he was welcomed to stay in the four families’ homes on a rotation system. One of them strongly objected to it, but she was persuaded in the end. Thus begins a very peculiar ‘revolving temporary residency life’.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2018/03/15/march-2018-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri[/url]]",

The legendary Ninth Correctional Precinct was an inescapable fortress, constructed on a remote island far out in the open seas.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo, there lived an eccentric young man named Minato Shuuichirou. He was infamous among law enforcement as the \"Flasher.\" Shuuichirou absolutely loathed the idea of clothing, and being stark naked was just second nature to him.\n\nHe was a daredevil who lived life on the edge, never hesitating to put his neck on the line time and time again. Then, one fateful sunny day, his luck ran out, and he was arrested for public indecency and obstruction of justice.\n\nIn court, he passionately defended his actions, claiming his brazen exhibitions were a form of art. Nonetheless, his arguments landed with a thud, as the bewildered listeners couldn't wrap their heads around such an offbeat perspective. He was ultimately convicted of assaulting a police officer and multiple counts of indecent exposure, earning him a 10-year sentence filled with back-breaking labor.\n\nTo make matters worse, he was considered \"beyond rehabilitation\" and banished to the notorious Tulip Prison.\n\nCan this daring exhibitionist make it in a prison packed with shady characters? This institution, ominously nicknamed \"HENTAI,\" is anything but a picnic for the unlucky folks stuck inside.\n\n[Translated and edited from [url=https://qruppo.com/products/henpri/]official website[/url]]",

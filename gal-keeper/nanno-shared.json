He worked hard to pass the entrance exam for the only school in the town and successfully achieved his long-cherished dream!\n\nHe moved back to the town for a new start, planning on living by himself in his childhood home, but it was in such a dilapidated state that it was essentially uninhabitable. Without the money to look for a temporary residence, Takuma was at a loss as to what to do.\n\nFortunately, his childhood friends came to his rescue! While he couldn’t live with them forever, he was welcomed to stay in the four families’ homes on a rotation system. One of them strongly objected to it, but she was persuaded in the end. Thus begins a very peculiar ‘revolving temporary residency life’.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2018/03/15/march-2018-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri[/url]]",

      "description": "-\"Tulip Prison\"\nThis is where the worst of the worst, the ones deemed \"beyond redemption,\" are locked up. The legendary Ninth Correctional Precinct was an inescapable fortress, constructed on a remote island far out in the open seas.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo, there lived an eccentric young man named Minato Shuuichirou. He was infamous among law enforcement as the \"Flasher.\" Shuuichirou absolutely loathed the idea of clothing, and being stark naked was just second nature to him.\n\nHe was a daredevil who lived life on the edge, never hesitating to put his neck on the line time and time again. Then, one fateful sunny day, his luck ran out, and he was arrested for public indecency and obstruction of justice.\n\nIn court, he passionately defended his actions, claiming his brazen exhibitions were a form of art. Nonetheless, his arguments landed with a thud, as the bewildered listeners couldn't wrap their heads around such an offbeat perspective. He was ultimately convicted of assaulting a police officer and multiple counts of indecent exposure, earning him a 10-year sentence filled with back-breaking labor.\n\nTo make matters worse, he was considered \"beyond rehabilitation\" and banished to the notorious Tulip Prison.\n\nCan this daring exhibitionist make it in a prison packed with shady characters? This institution, ominously nicknamed \"HENTAI,\" is anything but a picnic for the unlucky folks stuck inside.\n\n[Translated and edited from [url=https://qruppo.com/products/henpri/]official website[/url]]",

      "description": "One summer night, a violent storm battered the remote seaside village of Shinju Town. The disaster left deep scars on both the land and the hearts of its inhabitants, and before long the town was abandoned—its people vanishing, leaving behind a trail of unfulfilled yearnings and buried secrets…\n\nSeven years later, on another summer day, Kawakura Reiichi—a university student—steps alone into the ruined remains of Shinju Town.\n\nIt all begins with his late grandfather’s final wish—a brief return home to decide the fate of the house where they once lived together.\n\nThen, amid the lingering aromas and familiar vistas of a town that feels like another world, Reiichi meets a mysterious girl who calls herself \"Shinju.\"\n\n[i]\"Reiichi… you are destined to be the sacrifice that fulfills the shrine maiden and the box.\"[/i]\n\nReiichi and four girls find themselves trapped in Shinju Town, isolated from the outside world.\n\nAmong them is Mishio Haruna, a childhood friend who bears a striking resemblance to Shinju; Niinuma Suzu, another childhood friend from the old days of Shinju Town—a little sister in spirit; Ryugatou Yachiyo, a girl on a quest to uncover the town’s legendary treasure; and Tsuzuki Nanase, a university peer drawn into Reiichi’s troubled orbit. Then, in a chilling command, Shinju orders Reiichi to rape and impregnate the imprisoned girls.\n\nThough Reiichi and his companions band together in search of an escape, an insidious, erotic force—bound up with dark ties to their past—lures them into a vortex of debauchery, as the town fills with seductive moans.\n\nTwo girls mirror each other. \nFragmented memories and a promise once made. \nThe true identity of the deity worshipped in the town. \nThe dormant desires and sins slumbering in the forsaken village.\n\nFacing hidden truths, can Reiichi and the others ever return to the world they once knew?\n\nWhat lies concealed in the mysterious box—promised hope or the desire that seductively leads to ruin?\n\n[Translated and edited from the official site: https://www.escude.co.jp/product/haison2/world.html]",

In addition, the rest of his senses: touch, hearing, smell, and taste, are also impaired, similar to his sight, further damaging his mental health.\n\nFuminori's desire to live dwindles, and one night, while still in the hospital, he contemplates suicide.

Our hero, Koga Nao, finds himself in a classic \"morning after\" scenario with a girl he barely knows.\n\n\"You're gonna own up to this... so... you'd better date me, got it?\" demands Toiro Kirame, the girl he met at a mixer. Koga's pretty sure he was just playing Good Samaritan, but she's convinced they hooked up, and before he knows it, he's being strong-armed into \"taking responsibility.\"\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, his long-time crush, Nobuta Yua, picks this moment to drop a bombshell: \"I've decided to grace you with my presence as your girlfriend! Aren't you over the moon, Koga?\"\n\nTalk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place! After pining for Yua for ages, Koga can't exactly say no now, can he? And just like that, our protagonist makes his grand debut as an accidental two-timing scumbag.\n\nNow he's juggling two girlfriends, watching his web of lies grow more tangled by the day. As he racks his brain for a way out, the relationships around him twist and turn. To make matters worse, folks around his girlfriends are getting suspicious, and the walls are closing in.\n\nWill he sink deeper into this bottomless love swamp that's way beyond simple two-timing? Or can he somehow pull off a miracle and find a happy ending where nobody gets hurt?\n\nBuckle up for a wild ride! This roller-coaster romantic comedy – packed with heart-racing thrills and stomach-churning suspense – proves that sometimes love is a battlefield, and Koga's fighting a war on two fronts!\n\n[Translated from [url=http://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=1162879]Getchu[/url]]",

Once close, their relationship changed, and Haruhi's attitude toward her brother Sango took a turn for the worse.\n\nSango, a serious-minded person, blames himself for the rift and silently endures, hoping they can return to the way they once were.\n\nOne day, overwhelmed by his worries about their relationship, Sango even dreams of doing indecent things with Haruhi. Yet, in reality, nothing between them has changed.\n\nWill they carefully untangle the knots in their relationship and rebuild their bond?\n\nOr will they fail to recognize their feelings that have drifted apart, pulling too hard and tearing everything apart?\n\n[Translated and edited from the [url=https://www.cuffs.co.jp/products/rinri/#story]Official website[/url]]",

She asked him if he was bored, and he dismissed her as a fortune teller or promoting some religious group. Then, to his amazement, everything around him froze as if time had stopped. At first he thought it was a prank, but he had no choice but to believe in it when he saw that animals also stopped in their tracks.\n\n“This is called the Atropos watch and it has the power to stop time.\nYou probably notice that the second hand is still moving.\nIt can stop time for five minutes; in other words, time will move again after the second hand has made five rotations.”\n\nYuuma wondered why she was explaining all this to him. She thrust the pocketwatch in his hand and left saying:\n\n“You’re bored, aren’t you? Please use it to spice up your dull life.”\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2018/10/17/october-2018-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri~![/url]]",

      "description": "One year ago, Tokiya fell in love with Kanae at first sight. For the purpose of declaring his feelings for her, he underwent hell-like training from his younger sister Meguri and studied like mad to enter her school Seimatsurika Academy. However, Tokiya was quite the introverted person and didn’t have any confidence. Meguri suggested that he use the Asasaka family’s hidden technique ‘kokkai no gi’, which can make females attracted to him and give him a period of popularity, at the expense of the possibility of marriage in the future.\n\nTokiya did the ceremony clinging on to this last hope and immediately saw its effect on Meguri. Freshly confident, he confessed to Kanae under the sakura tree. However, she replied that they should start off as friends. Why didn’t the technique work as expected? He resigned himself to starting off as friends with her, but it seems that other cute girls are trying to seduce him!\n\n[From [url=http://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/november-2013-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

And what's more, when he woke up, it was the morning of the very day he had died. He proceeded to relive the same day, unable to grasp the reality of his situation. Kousei soon realized that his previous experience was not some prophetic dream, nor was he experiencing deja vu; everything was taking place the exact same way. \n\nOverwhelmed by fear due to the unbelievable situation he has found himself in, he came back to the place where he had died. Then, at the moment of the accident, Kousei met a death goddess accompanied by a talking cat. The death goddess informed him that he has not yet avoided his death. In order to escape his grisly fate, Kousei must assist the death goddess with her work. And naturally, this means the opening of a café together. \n\nBy rewinding the world, Kousei may have overcome his fate for now, but can he overcome the certain death his future holds for him? This is the story of one man's love and his defiance of the world and his own fate... maybe?\n\n[Source: [url=https://stella.nekonyansoft.com/story.html]NekoNyan website[/url]]",

      "description": "Yuzuki came to the town of Yuunagi as the leaves were starting to change colour. The first person he met was a cute cat-eared waitress, who was handing out pamphlets on the street.\n\n“T-This is Cafe Setaria. Please come in!”\n\nWhen he was led into the cafe by the waitress Chieri, the other girls there also had animal ears. Seeing his wondering look, they worriedly asked him:\n\n“Could it be… that you could see these ears?”\n\nThey explained that they were actually hybrid beasts whose ears and tails cannot be seen by normal humans. After learning about their secret, he started working at the cafe with them, while being both shocked and impressed at the differences between them and humans.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2020/01/30/january-2020-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri~![/url]]",

      "description": "The village of Hoori lies deep in the middle of the mountains, inaccessible by rail. Since there isn’t much interaction with its surroundings, the town seems like it is stuck in the past. However, it is because of this exact olden feel and subsequent development that it has turned into a nice hot-springs town for tourists.\n\nOne of the popular sightseeing spots is the legendary katana Murasamemaru, embedded in stone. No one has been able to pull it out… until Masaomi somehow broke it in half. He has to take responsibility for his actions: “Marriage” with ‘shrine maiden princess’ Yoshino!? He was perplexed at the unexpected turn of events, but this is only just the beginning. What lies ahead for him is a much more peculiar and mysterious life, including his new fiancée, a mysterious girl who only he could touch, and the secret behind the curse that remains on the town.\n\nWhat will become of Masaomi’s love amidst his rapidly changing life? The answer lies within the Murasamemaru in his hands.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2016/07/28/july-2016-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

New buildings are sprouting up everywhere, and the people are ecstatic.\n\nThe old disappears and the new is born, but there are some people, some places, some things, that nobody notices... or perhaps nobody chooses to notice them.\n\nThis is a story of people who live for one year... in such a little corner of the city.\n\nKanna is a first-year high school student who's involved in a traffic accident during the summer. She finds herself unable to stay in her hometown any longer.\n\nJing fails his university entrance exams in China. He spends a year or so working at a job he doesn't like.\n\nBoth of them hear of the incredible opportunities presenting themselves in the bubble economy of Tokyo. Therefore, Kanna drops out of high school and goes to Tokyo. Jing quits his job and goes to Japan.\n\nThe job both of them set their eyes on, would have them simply living in an old, run-down train station. Although the job only pays a measly 400 yen per hour, it runs for 24 hours a day, so it really isn't that bad. They wouldn't have to pay rent, heating, or electricity.\n\nKanna is a bit awkward around people, and Jing doesn't speak Japanese. The employer only wants one person. Neither wants to give up on this job, so the woman in charge recommends that they simply do it together...\n\n[From [url=https://www.mangagamer.com/detail.php?product_code=1243]MangaGamer[/url]]",

However, things haven't gone as he hoped.\n\nOne day, Yuzuru—who works part-time at the company—loses a USB stick containing important data he was entrusted with.\nHeld responsible, he finds himself in a difficult situation.\nTo protect Yuzuru, Rin resolves to accept Touya’s offer of a “special private one-on-one lesson” in exchange for her idol debut.\n\nUntil a few days ago, another trainee had been living with Touya in his home, but she has since left.\nNow, Rin and Touya are alone together.\nDespite her unease about the private lessons, Rin steels herself—for Yuzuru’s sake.\n\nFrom that day forward, Yuzuru begins to notice Rin gradually changing... and can't shake the feeling that something is terribly wrong——.",
